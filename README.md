# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

This repository contains my implementations and solutions for various data structures and algorithms problems. It's organized to help me practice and improve my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Contents

The repository is structured into directories, each representing a specific problem or category. Here's a brief overview:

*   **Array challenge: pair product problem/**: Contains a Python solution (`pair.py`) to check if any two numbers in an array can be multiplied to exceed double the sum of all elements. Includes debugging notes (`DEBUG.md`) and problem description (`README.md`).
*   **Array Reduction Problem/**: Contains a Python solution (`reduct.py`) that reduces an array to a single number by repeatedly taking differences of adjacent elements. Includes debugging notes (`DEBUG.md`) and problem description (`README.md`).
*   **FizzBuzz /**: Contains a Python implementation (`fb.py`) of the classic FizzBuzz problem. Includes debugging notes (`DEBUG.md`) and problem description (`README.md`).
*   **invalidTransaction/**: Contains a Python solution (`invalidTransactions.py`) for identifying invalid transactions based on certain criteria (amount and proximity to other transactions). Includes problem description (`README.md`).
*   **Python shopping cart/**: Contains a Python implementation (`shopcart.py`) of a shopping cart with add, remove, and change operations. Includes debugging notes (`DEBUG.md`) and problem description (`README.md`).
*   **scheduleAB/**: Contains a problem description (`README.md`) and an empty Python file (`schedule.py`) for scheduling interviews in two cities.

## Structure Details

Each problem directory typically includes:

*   **README.md**: A description of the problem, instructions, and example test cases.
*   **[problem_name].py**: The Python implementation of the solution.
*   **DEBUG.md**: Debugging steps, common issues, and testing strategies used during development.

## How to Use

1.  **Browse the directories:** Explore the different problem categories and their respective solutions.
2.  **Read the README.md:** Understand the problem statement, requirements, and constraints.
3.  **Review the code:** Examine the Python implementation (`.py` file) to understand the solution approach.
4.  **Check DEBUG.md:** Learn about the debugging process, potential issues, and testing strategies.
5.  **Run the code:** Execute the Python scripts to test the solutions and verify their correctness.
