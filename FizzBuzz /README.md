# FizzBuzz Implementation Instructions

## Problem Understanding
Create a function `StringChallenge(num)` that returns a string containing numbers from 1 to `num` with special replacements:
- Numbers divisible by 3 → "Fizz"
- Numbers divisible by 5 → "Buzz"  
- Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 → "FizzBuzz"
- All other numbers → the number itself
- All elements separated by spaces

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Function Setup
```python
def StringChallenge(num):
    result = []  # List to store our results
```

### Step 2: Create the Loop
```python
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    # Process each number from 1 to num (inclusive)
```

### Step 3: Implement Logic (Order Matters!)
The order of conditions is crucial - check most specific first:

```python
if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
    result.append("FizzBuzz")  # Divisible by both
elif i % 3 == 0:
    result.append("Fizz")      # Divisible by 3 only
elif i % 5 == 0:
    result.append("Buzz")      # Divisible by 5 only
else:
    result.append(str(i))      # Regular number (convert to string)
```

### Step 4: Return the Result
```python
return " ".join(result)  # Join all elements with spaces
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Order matters**: Check for divisibility by both 3 and 5 first
2. **Convert numbers to strings**: Use `str(i)` for regular numbers
3. **Use modulo operator**: `%` gives remainder after division
4. **Join with spaces**: Use `" ".join()` to create the final string
5. **Range is inclusive**: `range(1, num + 1)` includes `num`

## Test Cases to Verify
- Input: 3 → Output: "1 2 Fizz"
- Input: 5 → Output: "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz"
- Input: 15 → Should include "FizzBuzz" at position 15
- Input: 16 → Should match the example given in the problem
