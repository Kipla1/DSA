# Shopping Cart Function - Key Fixes

## Problem 1: Add Operation
**Issue**: Logic was backwards - trying to add to non-existent key first
**Fix**: Check if product exists first, then either add to existing quantity or create new entry

## Problem 2: Remove Operation  
**Issue**: Setting quantity to 0 instead of actually removing the item
**Fix**: Use `del cart[product_id]` to completely remove the item from dictionary

## Problem 3: Change Operation
**Issue**: 
- Subtracting 1 from quantity for no reason
- Not handling quantity = 0 case (should remove item)
- Poor condition checking

**Fix**: 
- Set quantity directly when > 0
- Remove item when quantity â‰¤ 0
- Proper validation of quantity field

## Key Improvements:
1. Fixed condition order in add operation
2. Actually remove items instead of setting to 0
3. Handle edge cases (non-existent products, zero quantities)
4. Prevent KeyErrors with proper existence checks
